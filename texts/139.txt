Study Purpose:In this study, RNA-sequencing is used to identify transcriptional differences in the sympathetic stellate ganglia between the 16-week-old normotensive Wistar strain and the spontaneously hypertensive rat, SHR, strain. This dataset should allow for further molecular characterization of hypertensive changes in a cardiac-innervating sympathetic ganglion.

Data Collection: RNA-sequencing analysis of dataset derived from 10.1038/sdata.2018.123 and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE110197 (Gene expression omnibus GSE110197). The analysis contains differential expression analysis and gene ontology analysis of Wistar vs SHR right stellate ganglion comparison at 15-16 weeks of age. Data was analyzed by a pipeline consisting of Salmon, DESeq2, and cluster profile.

Primary Conclusion: none stated

Curator's Notes

Experimental Design: Right stellate ganglia were removed from four Wistar rats and four spontaneously hypertensive rat, SHR, rats at 16-weeks of age. These eight animals, four of each strain, constituted biological replicates. The clean stellate ganglia were chopped, triturated, digested in RNeasy RLT buffer, and RNA was extracted. Comparison of normotensive and hypertensive rat stellate ganglia was completed. Four biological replicates for both 16-week Wistar (Wistar-control) and SHR (SHR-diseased) stellate ganglia samples were contrasted by high throughput sequencing. The samples were sequenced with a paired-end protocol (75 base pairs).

Completeness: This dataset is complete.

Subjects & Samples: (n=4) Wistar and (n=4) Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats age between 15-16 weeks were used in the study.

Primary vs derivative data:. There is no primary data included in this dataset. Average values per strain, differential expression, Gene Ontology and KEGG data are listed in relevant derivative folders under samples.
