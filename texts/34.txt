Study Purpose: Neuromodulation is emerging as an alternative therapy to bowel dysfunctions. However, knowledge of optimal stimulation modalities is lacking. This study aims to map the colonic wall impedance and luminal pressure changes to electrical stimulation of the colon and autonomic nerves in a porcine model.

Data Collection: Direct electrical stimulation of proximal (pC), transverse (tC) and distal (dC) colon was done using planar flexible multi-electrode array panels. In all instances, pC, tC, and dC wall bioimpedance, and luminal pressure (manometry) changes were monitored before, during, and after stimulation. The regional colonic motility index was quantified by measuring the area under the curve of the phasic component of the luminal pressure trace (pAUC). Colonic luminal pressure map was generated.

Primary Conclusion: Direct colon wall electrical stimulation causes primarily robust local contractions but also modulates distant colonic regions motility.

Curator's Notes

Experimental Design: Anesthetized male Yucatan pigs (27-32 kg) were used and assigned to 3 experimental groups by stimulation organ: (1) direct stimulation - transverse colon, (2) direct stimulation-proximal colon, and (3) direct stimulation - distal colon. Signals recorded from manometry probes inserted into the proximal, transverse, and distal colonic regions. The probes were used to measure the effect of electrical stimulation, using planar electrodes apposed to the serosal side of the colonic tissue at multiple sites, in an acutely anesthetized preparation. The effect of stimulation was quantified as motility index assessments before, during, and after stimulation, and the data was used to create a functional map of colonic motor response to localized colon stimulations.
